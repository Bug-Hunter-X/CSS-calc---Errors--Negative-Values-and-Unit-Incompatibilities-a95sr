The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if the calculation results in a value that is not a valid CSS length unit, such as negative values for widths or heights, it can lead to unexpected rendering issues or errors. For instance, if the result of a calculation is a negative value for the `width` property, the element might not be displayed correctly or might collapse entirely.  Another issue arises when using `calc()` with percentages and other units simultaneously. If the calculation order or unit compatibility is not carefully managed, it can lead to incorrect results and unexpected visual effects. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px)` works as expected, but a complex calculation involving multiple units might fail silently or produce an incorrect result.
